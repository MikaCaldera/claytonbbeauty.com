        citation: Celeste Neilsen
      - quotation: Being a client of Clayton's for over 15yrs has been an absolute
          privilege. Clayton always listens to his clients vision which helps
          him align his talents to meet those goals. He strives for the best
          with every situation-a perfectionist which always reflects in the
          outcomes of each individual he services. He pursues continuous self
          development in his craft with colors, cuts and styles. This is why I
          drive two hours to see him for every appointment as he is best in
          class.
