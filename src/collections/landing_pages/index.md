    body: Clayton’s first interest in beauty came at an early age. As a child, he
      would hang out at his Aunt’s salon. In addition, to sweeping hair, he
      would watch the joy of each client as they left the salon. At the age of
      18, Clayton began his journey in the beauty industry. 12 years later he
      has built up a long list of clients that leave his chair with the same
      excitement on their faces he remembered seeing as a child. Always wanting
      to learn and grow as a stylist he is always looking to enhance his
      technique. He has assisted in a cover shoot for Seventeen Magazine, NYC
      Fashion Week, as well as working on local events, photo shoots, and
      fashion shows. Clayton’s true passion is his eye for color and love for
      chemistry which makes him the eclectic colorist and stylist he is today.
      If length is what you need he is also an extension specialist. Whatever
      your hair need is, Clayton can deliver.

    quotes:
      - quotation: Being a client of Clayton's for over 15yrs has been an absolute
          privilege. Clayton always listens to his clients vision which helps
          him align his talents to meet those goals. He strives for the best
          with every situation-a perfectionist which always reflects in the
          outcomes of each individual he services. He pursues continuous self
          development in his craft with colors, cuts and styles. This is why I
          drive two hours to see him for every appointment as he is best in
          class.
