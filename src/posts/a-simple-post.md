> Being a client of Clayton's for over 15yrs has been an absolute privilege. Clayton always listens to his clients vision which helps him align his talents to meet those goals. He strives for the best with every situation-a perfectionist which always reflects in the outcomes of each individual he services. He pursues continuous self development in his craft with colors, cuts and styles. This is why I drive two hours to see him for every appointment as he is best in class.
