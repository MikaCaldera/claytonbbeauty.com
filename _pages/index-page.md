      Clayton’s talent, creativity, and passion for the beauty industry came
      very natural at a young age. Clayton had the opportunity to spend time in
      his Aunt Erin’s salon, sweeping hair, taking out rollers and being able to
      see what the salon experience was all about. At the age of 18 his journey
      in the beauty industry began, he has been a stylist since 2004. Always
      continuing education, wanting to grow as a stylist to enhance his
      techniques and salon experience. He has had many opportunities such as
      working at MAC cosmetics, local events, photo shoots, fashion shows and
      charities. He has also earned the opportunity to assist at a Latin America
      Seventeen Magazine photo shoot, styling for NYC Fashion Week for two
      consecutive years, and later to become a Gold Key Style educator for Kevin
      Murphy.



      If length, fullness, or a change is what you need Clayton has been certified with Great Lengths Hair extensions hot and cold fusions since 2006, as well as being certified through Hot Head Tape Ins. He prides himself in providing an amazing salon experience and cares about all of your hair needs.

        blurb: Being a client of Clayton's for over 15yrs has been an absolute
          privilege. Clayton always listens to his clients vision which helps
          him align his talents to meet those goals. He strives for the best
          with every situation-a perfectionist which always reflects in the
          outcomes of each individual he services. He pursues continuous self
          development in his craft with colors, cuts and styles. This is why I
          drive two hours to see him for every appointment as he is best in
          class.
